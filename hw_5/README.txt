The important aspects of this homework are containted in the last two jupyter cells (the 4 plots). The first cell contains temperature and precipation correlation vs. geographical distance plots. While the second contains correlation vs longitudinal difference plots. Note that the geographical distance was found using a custom function defined 3 cells prior.

In these plots, note that there isn't a particularly strong geographical dependence on correlation. Within each correlation calculation (i.e. 1 day in advance) the correlation remains somewhat constant. I believe that this is because we are only plotting the top 10 pairs. If we were to include other pairs, I believe that we would recover intuitive distance dependence. This is because we have saturated the maximum correlation possible within each day difference.

However, notice that the maximum correlation within each day-run is lower for more time between the correlation. This is intuitive because the weather is more likely to change for further distances. However, notice that several of the distances are comparable between the 3 day-runs even though we expect the larger distances to correlate more strongly for more day-separations. It is possible that some of this is biased by more consistent weather patterns (if it is raining in seattle/San Fransisco one day it will likely do so several days in a row). Also note that the far distance correlations only appear in the longer day-separation runs. This is expected.

Moving on to the precipitation correlation, we note that the strongest correlations are mostly very close together (comparable to the temperature correlations) except for a single 7-day-separated pair. Also, note that the correlations are much lower than for temperature, likely because rain decreases as it moves in-land meaning that rain on the west coast one day wouldn't imply rain necessarily in Denver in the foreseeable future. This also depends on the mountain regions, as a rain shadow is significant across short distances.
